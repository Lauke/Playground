# Playground
* Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript

## 
* Playername — Store useful values inside variables. Entering a new name and then store that name in a variable called name.
* Guess the number - Small javascript based guessing game.
* Error handling — Learned the difference between syntax errors, logic error & how to tackle them with the firefox built-in developer tools.
* Calculation — Learned about basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators
* Template literals — Learned about the newer syntax that provides more flexible, easier to read strings.
* Useful string methods — Strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another. (active learning exercise is still a struggle at this point) 
* A neat way of storing a list of data items under a single variable name. Here we look at why this is useful, then explore how to create an array, retrieve, add, and remove items stored in an array, and more besides.

## Purpose
* Purpose of the playground is to get a better understanding of javascript using the Firefox MDN Documentation
